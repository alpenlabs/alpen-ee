"""End-to-end EE chunk + acct prover pipeline check.

Drives a non-trivial *mix* of EVM activity through the EE — plain ETH
transfers, storage-writing contract deployments, and large-runtime
contract deployments — then verifies (a) every transaction's on-chain
effect is correct and (b) the produced blocks roll through chunk-seal,
chunk proof, acct proof, and OL submission.

Runs against the zkaleido `NativeHost` (dev-prover mode) by default; set
`EE_PROVER_BACKEND=sp1` (see `factories/alpen_client.py`) to run the same
checks against the real SP1 Groth16 prover instead. The heavy tx mix and
tight batch-sealing count below are tuned for the fast native default —
under the real backend expect this test to take much longer, since it
drives several full chunk+acct proof rounds.

The mix matters: it exercises different code paths in the chunk witness
extraction:
  - transfers → balance/nonce reads + writes
  - storage_filler → SSTORE chains with distinct slot keys
  - large_runtime → distinct bytecode hashes flowing through the
    content-addressed `BytecodeSchema` (phase 2 redesign)

Native mode runs the full guest program logic in plain Rust; only the
zk proof generation itself is bypassed. So this test exercises:
  - Inline per-block witness production: during payload build,
    `build_block_witness_from_executed_state` harvests the depth-0 witness
    parts straight from the just-executed reth `State` (no re-execution) into a
    `BlockWitnessRecord`, carried on the payload and persisted to the
    `BlockWitnessStore`. A capture failure fails the payload build, so this
    gates block acceptance.
  - `ChunkSpec::fetch_input` (sled reads of the per-block `BlockWitnessRecord`s,
    unioned into one chunk-level sparse state via
    `EvmPartialState::from_witness_parts` / rsp `from_execution_witness`)
  - `AccessedStateGenerator` exex (per-block accessed-state writes, feeding
    the account proof's batch-range witness)
  - The `EeChunkProgram` guest (per-block state transition checks, MPT validation)
  - The `EeAcctProgram` guest (update aggregation, pub-params construction)
  - The paas service framework (task lifecycle, receipt hooks, OL submission)

The test asserts via the service.log signals the rest of the codebase
already produces — no storage poking, no new RPC surface. Each
assertion is independent so a regression at any single stage pinpoints
the failure.
N.B. The test is intended to be short-lived and parts to be substituted
with proper accessors or state asserts (and not logs).
