    Walks every block in the range and identifies commit txs by an

    Each commit has dynamic-many P2TR outputs; for every P2TR output
    `vout`, the matching reveal tx is the one that spends `(commit_txid,
    vout)`. The scanner reads reveals from the witness of those spending
    txs.

    The writer waits for a multi-reveal commit to confirm before
    broadcasting any reveals, so the commit and its reveals routinely
    land in **different** L1 blocks. To pair them correctly across
    scan-window boundaries this scanner must always be called with
    `start_height` covering the full range from the first DA-bearing
    block (e.g. baseline_l1_height) up to the current tip — never an
    incremental delta. Callers should rebuild the result list each pass
    rather than appending, since the scanner re-emits every envelope
    whose commit + all reveals are now visible. Envelopes whose reveals
    have not yet confirmed are simply omitted; they will appear on a
    later scan once the reveals are mined.
