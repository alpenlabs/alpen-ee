//! Per-block accessed-state and content-addressed bytecode storage.

//! Producer: the `AccessedStateGenerator` exex (phase 2 of the EE prover
//! redesign), which writes one record per committed block plus any newly
//! seen bytecodes.
//!
//! Consumer: the chunk-builder at chunk-seal time, replacing today's
//! per-block re-execution loop inside `RangeWitnessExtractor`.

/// Two lifecycles share the trait because both feeds are written by the

///
/// - **Per-block records** are tied to chain canonicality. On reorg, the exex deletes records for
///   the orphaned block hashes.
/// - **Bytecodes** are content-addressed by code hash. Once written they are never deleted — same
///   contract referenced by many chunks shares one stored copy.
