//! Host-side helpers for constructing the [`DaWitness`] the
//! [`verification`](crate::verification) module checks. Gated behind the
//! `builders` feature so guest/proof builds link only the verifier.
//!
//! - `inclusion` — the generic L1 byte-blob inclusion layer (walking the batch's L1 blocks, wtxid
//!   proofs, blob reassembly), execution-environment agnostic.
//! - `dedup` — the EVM bytecode-dedup layer: which bytecodes the blob omits, resolving their
//!   preimages, and the [`DedupWitnessResolver`] seam that produces the
//!   [`DedupWitness`](alpen_ee_da_types::DedupWitness).
//! - [`build_da_witness`] — the single entry point that orchestrates the two into a [`DaWitness`].
