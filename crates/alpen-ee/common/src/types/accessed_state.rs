//! Per-block accessed-state record + bytecode storage support.
//!
//! Produced by the `AccessedStateGenerator` exex (phase 2 of the EE prover
//! redesign) when reth commits a block: the exex re-executes the block
//! wrapped in a `CacheDBProvider` against the parent state, then writes
//! what the block *read* (accounts, slots, code hashes, ancestor heights
//! for BLOCKHASH) here, plus any newly-referenced bytecodes into the
//! sibling bytecode tree.
//!
//! Consumer: the acct-proof range-witness extractor. It unions the per-block
//! records of a batch's blocks into a single multiproof target set, then runs
//! the pre/post state multiproofs to assemble the batch witness. With this
//! cache in place, the extractor no longer has to re-execute blocks.
